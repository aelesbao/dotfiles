# How the image is parse, in order to get the colors:
# full - resized - wal - thumb -  fastresize - kmeans
backend = "full"

# What color space to use to produce and select the most prominent colors:
# lab - labmixed - lch - lchmixed

# NOTE: All filters will fill 16 colors (from color0 to color15), 16 color
#       variations are the 'ilusion' of more colors by opaquing color1 to color5.
# Use the most prominent colors in a way that makes sense, a scheme:
#  * dark        - 8 dark colors, dark background and light contrast
#  * dark16      - Same as `dark` but uses the 16 colors trick
#  * harddark    - Same as `dark` with hard hue colors
#  * harddark16  - Harddark with 16 color variation
#  * light       - Light bg, dark fg
#  * light16     - Same as `light` but uses the 16 color trick
#  * softdark    - Variant of softlight, uses the lightest colors and a dark
#                   background (could be interpreted as `dark` inversed)
#  * softdark16  - softdark with 16 color variation
#  * softlight   - Light with soft pastel colors, counterpart of `harddark`
#  * softlight16 - softlight with 16 color variation
